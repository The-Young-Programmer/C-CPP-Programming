# Simple Encryption and Decryption project in C++ 

### What is Cryptography?

 Cryptography is the study of a secure way of transmitting data from person to person, where the data is modified only to be understandable by the intended persons.
In short, if we want to send data or messages securely, then we use cryptographic techniques to avoid the intervention of unwanted persons or systems.

## Code Explanation

In the main function, we are using a switch-case to choose between encryption or decryption.

- In encryption, we are adding an integer to the character so that it changed to the character of the new ASCII value.

- When it comes to decryption, we take the same encrypted text and then change it by subtracting the same integer.
