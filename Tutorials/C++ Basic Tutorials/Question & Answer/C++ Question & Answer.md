<details><summary> What are the advantages of C++?</summary>

- C++ is a highly portable language means we can say that the software developed using C++ language can run on any platform
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language which includes the concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstruction, encapsulation
- C++ has the concept of inheritance. Through inheritance, one can eliminate the redundant code and can reuse the existing classes.
- Data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs so that the program cannot be attacked by the invaders
- It contains a rich function library

<hr>

<details><summary>What are advantages of Inheritance? </summary>

- **Code Reuseability:** It means functiion inside base class is shared by all the derieved class
- **Time Saving:** Because there is no need to define existing property (same code) of a class in another class
- **Less Cost:** Because existing code is reused, it leads to less develoment and maintainance costs.
- It helps to reduce code redundancy.

- It is used to store group of data simultaneously
- It can store data of same data type (means an integer array can only store integer value, character array can only store only character value, and so on)
- We can not fetch data from array directly therefore we use index point
- The indexing of array always start with 0
- Index value is always an integer number
- array maybe of any data type like int, float, char, etc
    - for example:
    `int ar[5]={10,20,30,50,80};`
    Here 'ar' is the name of array and '5' is the size of array means this array can store atmost 5 value

- It is a collction of statement that performs a specific task
- It executes when it is called by its name 
- A large program is divided into a number of small building block for simplicity and this building block is called function

- In this type of inheritance atleast three class are compulsory

</details>

<details><summary> What is Identifier</summary>

- It is a name of differnt part of programming elements like variable name, method name, etc
- It is a string of alphanumeric characters that begins with alphabet or underscore
    - For example:
    `int x=5;`
    Here 'x' ia a variable or we can say that identifiers

</details>

<hr>

<details><summary> What is Copy Constructor?</summary>

- In this type of constructor one object with parameter is copied into another object so it is called copy constructor

</details>

<hr>

<details><summary> Types of function?</summary>

There are two types of function in C
- Predefined function
- Userdefined function

</details>

<hr>

<details><summary> What is union?</summary>

- It is a collection of data of different data type
- It is a user defined data type
- Dat is of int, char, float, double, etc data type
- We can access the member of union by making the varaible of union
- union keyword is used to create a union
- union can store single value at a time 

</details>

<hr>

<details><summary>What is difference between structure and union?</summary>

- Structure supports multiple value simultaneously but union support only one value at a time because in structure, each variable have its own memory block but in union a single memory block is shared by all variable union. 

</details>

<hr>

<details><summary> What is Default constructor</summary>

- The constructor with no parameter is called default constructor

</details>
