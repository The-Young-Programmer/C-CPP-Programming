Basic Calculator in C++ (GUI)



<p>
<br>
<b>Basic Calculator in C++ (GUI)</b> is a Calculator that can be used to perform all the basic arithmetical operations viz. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  

The calculator has a three dimensional shape, and so do all of its buttons. In other words, it looks like a real world, three-dimensional object rather than a two dimensional shape rendered in a program.
